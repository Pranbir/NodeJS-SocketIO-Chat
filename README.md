 - Enter your name and choose a profile picture and enter.

 - There is an text input box, through which the user can send a text message to all online users. 
 - To send a private / direct message to a particular user, simply click on the user's name or on any message sent by that user. A new input box will be available through which the user can send a private message to that user.
 - All communications are sandbox. So none of the messages are stored on the server side. Messages are only stored inside the browser tab. That means that closing the tab will erase all communications, only new messages will be visible.
  - A video describing the use of the application is also available in the repository.
